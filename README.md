## Introduction

In the world of programming, continuous learning and practice are essential. This repository serves as a portfolio of my code challenge solutions. I regularly update it with new solutions as I tackle more challenges on various online platforms. Feel free to explore and review my code.

## Challenges

Here's a list of the online platforms I've solved challenges on and a brief description of each:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/): LeetCode is a popular platform for coding interviews and competitive programming. I've included my solutions to LeetCode problems in the `leetcode` directory.

- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/): CodeWars offers a wide range of programming challenges, often categorized by difficulty level and topics. My CodeWars solutions are organized in the `codewars` directory.

- [Other Platforms]: In the future, I may add solutions from additional platforms here.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each named after the challenge or the platform. Within each directory, you'll typically find the following files:

- `README.md`: Contains the problem statement and description.
- `solution.js` (or other language-specific file): Contains my solution to the problem written in JavaScript.
- Additional files, if necessary, for input/output testing or explanations.

## How to Use

To run the JavaScript code solutions provided using Node.js:

1. **Install Node.js**: If you haven't already, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Navigate to a Challenge Directory**: Go to the specific challenge directory you're interested in (e.g., `leetcode`, `codewars`).

3. **Choose a Solution**: Inside the challenge directory, you'll find a `solution.js` file, which contains my JavaScript solution.

4. **Open Terminal**: Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the challenge directory.

5. **Run the Code**: Use the `node` command to run the JavaScript file. For example:
   ```bash
   node solution.js
